# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is a machine learning application that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions from legitimate ones. This is a binary classification problem that aims to minimize false positives while detecting fraudulent activity accurately.

## Objective
To build a robust machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions based on transaction features, thereby helping financial institutions reduce fraud and protect customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones. It contains:

- **Columns**:
  - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction.
  - `V1, V2, ..., V28`: Principal components obtained using PCA.
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `Class`: Target variable where `1` indicates fraud and `0` indicates a legitimate transaction.

### Source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:
- [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Import the dataset using `pandas`.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Normalize the `Amount` column to scale transaction amounts.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Address class imbalance using techniques like:
  - Oversampling (SMOTE)
  - Undersampling
  - Class weighting

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions.
- Explore feature correlations using heatmaps and pair plots.
- Investigate transaction amounts and time patterns for fraud detection insights.

### 4. Model Development
Choose classification algorithms suitable for imbalanced datasets:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics:
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Area Under the Curve (AUC) and ROC Curve

### 6. Prediction
- Use the trained model to predict fraud on unseen data.
- Output predictions along with confidence scores.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
  - `imbalanced-learn` for handling class imbalance.

## Results
The project aims to achieve high precision and recall, focusing on minimizing false negatives (missed fraud cases). The final model performance will be presented using metrics such as the AUC-ROC curve.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate predictions.
4. Experiment with different models and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

## Key Files
- `creditcard.csv`: Dataset file.
- `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project (this file).

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time fraud detection using streaming data frameworks.
- Experiment with deep learning architectures for improved performance.
- Explore additional feature engineering techniques for better model interpretability.
- Develop a web application or API for deploying the model.
